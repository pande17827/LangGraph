              "AIMessage(content=\"<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking for the capital of India. Let me think. First, I know that India is a country in South Asia. The capital is a city that serves as the seat of government. I recall that Delhi is the capital. Wait, but there's also a historical context here. The city of Delhi has been the capital of various Indian kingdoms and empires over centuries, like the Mughal Empire. However, the modern capital of India is New Delhi, which is part of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. \\n\\nWait, sometimes people might confuse Delhi with New Delhi. Let me confirm. The Indian government is based in New Delhi, which is located within the Delhi NCR (National Capital Region). The city of Delhi itself is a union territory, and New Delhi is the administrative center. So the correct answer is New Delhi. But I should make sure there's no confusion with the city of Delhi. Maybe the user is asking for the city, and the answer is New Delhi. Alternatively, some sources might refer to Delhi as the capital, but technically, the administrative capital is New Delhi. \\n\\nAlso, considering the user might be a student or someone looking for a straightforward answer, it's important to state that the capital is New Delhi. However, since Delhi is often referred to as the capital, I should mention both to avoid confusion. Let me check a reliable source. Yes, according to official sources, the capital of India is New Delhi. The National Capital Territory of Delhi includes New Delhi and surrounding areas. So the answer is New Delhi. I should present that clearly and concisely.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of India is **New Delhi**. It is located in the state of Uttar Pradesh, within the National Capital Territory of Delhi. While the city of Delhi is often colloquially referred to as the capital, the administrative and political center of India is New Delhi.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'model': 'qwen3:8b', 'created_at': '2025-05-29T11:44:16.426864379Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 20906248188, 'load_duration': 7146252072, 'prompt_eval_count': 14, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1232691412, 'eval_count': 387, 'eval_duration': 12523798574, 'model_name': 'qwen3:8b'}, id='run--32a4b656-0be2-422c-b3ef-235e00d4c997-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 14, 'output_tokens': 387, 'total_tokens': 401})"
